# What is Hanger-Management?

The hAnger Management site is a one-stop shop for recepies. With our user friendly interface, users are able to find top recepies for their favorite dishes, or browse for exciting new ones to try. It also instantly provides users with the full nurtitional values of all the ingredients. 

# The User Experience

The home page provides you with two different search bars. 

The search bar on the left lets you search for recepies. Whether you are looking for something extremely specific like "Pan roasted chicken with chestnut sauce", or if you are just searching for anything with "Chicken", this will give you results for the top 10 recepies from "Edamam.com". From those results, you can click on the image of your choosing to get the full list of ingredients, and a clickable link to the full receipe instructions.

If you already know what you want to cook, the search bar on the right allows you input ingredients and provides you with the full nutritional value.

# Technologies Used
Front end: 
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* flexBox

Back end:
* Javascript
* jQuery

# Issues we ran into

* We started with three separate HTML pages and two .js pages, but we were eventually able to get everything on one HTML page and one .js page.
* We ran into some problms with displaying the returned information exactly hoe we wanted it, but with the use of flexBox we were able to make it much more visually appealing.
* Github pushes/pulls/branches/master/EvErYtHiNg!!!  This was a great excercise in learning something the "hard way" and making mistakes so big that you will be sure to never make them again.

# Future Developements:
* Home Button, and more development for the front
* Reviews on different Recepies
* Adding authentication
* Logging recepies for users, and creating recepie suggestions for returning users
* Executing searches with on.click AND on.key events
